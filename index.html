                        My name is Justin Brown, and I am an aspiring developer. I am 23 years old, and currently live
                        in
                        Mesa,
                        AZ.
                        I have been here throughout my entire life, and don't really plan on leaving. I graduated from
                        Skyline
                        High
                        School in 2013, and received some college credits from Mesa Community College the following
                        year.

                        Shortly after my first year of college I began working at a car repair shop as a mechanic, the
                        shop
                        was
                        conveniently called the Car Repair Co. A few years later I got an offer to be one of the
                        Service
                        Advisors
                        at Earnhardt Buick GMC, but within a couple years I realized that I didn't want to stay in that
                        field
                        of
                        work. So I changed careers, with the little knowledge I had, and became an AutoCAD Drafter. It
                        was
                        there
                        that I realized that I didn't so much love the drafting as much as I did fixing the issues that
                        came up
                        with the programs and trying to create lispertimes to combine processes. I started to try free
                        online
                        sources to teach myself some beginner HTML and CSS, and I decided I was ready to try out a
                        bootcamp,
                        and my
                        life as an aspiring developer began.
